## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology             |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Frontend     | React.js + Tailwind CSS + Vite |

## ⚙️ Project Setup

### 📦 Backend (Express + MongoDB)

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `server/`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_job
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Run the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 💻 Frontend (React + Tailwind + Vite)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Tailwind is configured via `postcss.config.cjs` and `tailwind.config.js`.

## 🧠 AI Usage & Prompt Logic

We use **Cohere’s `embed-english-v3.0` model** to semantically match users to job descriptions.

### Prompt Design

A user's profile is converted into a plain-text prompt such as:

```text
Skills: React, Node.js, AWS. Experience: 3 years. Preferences: Remote only.
```

This text is embedded and compared with each job’s embedding using **cosine similarity**. The top 3 matches are returned.

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Trade-Offs

- ⏱️ AI matching is synchronous for MVP simplicity
- 🔐 Authentication is cookie-based for cross-origin support
- 🚫 No file uploads or resumes — matching is profile-based
- 📄 Job creation is manual or seeded (no admin dashboard)
- ⚙️ Job search is not paginated; assumes small dataset
- 🌐 Render backend may have cold start latency (~50s)
